                <h2>General Terms and Conditions of Krause Global Resources & Trade GmbH</h2>
                <p style="color: var(--text-light); margin-bottom: 2rem;">Status: December 2025</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">§ 1 Scope</h3>
                <p>
                    (1) These General Terms and Conditions (hereinafter "GTC") apply to all contracts, 
                    deliveries, and other services between Krause Global Resources & Trade GmbH 
                    (hereinafter "Seller") and their contractual partners (hereinafter "Buyer").
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) Deviating, conflicting, or supplementary General Terms and Conditions of the Buyer 
                    shall not become part of the contract unless their validity is expressly agreed to in writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) These GTC also apply to all future business with the Buyer, insofar as they are 
                    legal transactions of a similar nature.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">§ 2 Conclusion of Contract</h3>
                <p>
                    (1) The Seller's offers are non-binding and subject to change unless expressly 
                    marked as binding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) The order of goods by the Buyer is considered a binding contractual offer. The Seller 
                    may accept this offer within 14 days of receipt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) The contract is concluded through the Seller's written order confirmation or through delivery 
                    of the goods.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">§ 3 Prices and Payment Terms</h3>
                <p>
                    (1) The prices valid at the time of order apply. All prices are subject to statutory 
                    value-added tax unless otherwise agreed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) Unless otherwise agreed, invoices are due for payment within 30 days of the invoice date 
                    without deduction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) In the event of default in payment by the Buyer, the Seller is entitled to charge 
                    default interest at a rate of 9 percentage points above the respective base interest rate. 
                    The assertion of higher default damage remains reserved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (4) The Buyer is only entitled to offset if his counterclaims have been legally established, 
                    are undisputed, or have been recognized by the Seller.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">§ 4 Delivery and Delivery Time</h3>
                <p>
                    (1) Delivery dates and delivery periods are only binding if they have been expressly 
                    confirmed in writing by the Seller as binding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) The delivery period begins with the date of the order confirmation, but not before 
                    clarification of all details necessary for order execution and not before receipt of an 
                    agreed advance payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) The Seller is entitled to make partial deliveries insofar as this is reasonable for the Buyer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (4) If non-compliance with the delivery period is due to force majeure (e.g., war, natural disasters, 
                    operational disruptions, official measures), the delivery period shall be extended appropriately.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">§ 5 Transfer of Risk</h3>
                <p>
                    (1) Risk passes to the Buyer as soon as the goods have been handed over to the carrier, 
                    freight forwarder, or other person or institution designated to execute the shipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) If shipment is delayed at the Buyer's request, risk passes to the Buyer with notification 
                    of readiness for shipment.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">§ 6 Warranty</h3>
                <p>
                    (1) The Seller warrants that the delivered goods have the agreed quality 
                    and are free from legal and material defects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) Claims for defects expire 12 months after transfer of risk, unless legally 
                    longer periods are mandatory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) The Buyer must inspect the goods immediately upon delivery for defects and 
                    notify apparent defects in writing within 7 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (4) In case of justified claims for defects, the Seller has the right to subsequent performance 
                    through repair or replacement delivery at his choice.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">§ 7 Liability</h3>
                <p>
                    (1) The Seller is liable without limitation for intent and gross negligence as well as for 
                    injury to life, body, or health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) In case of slightly negligent breach of essential contractual obligations, liability is 
                    limited to the contract-typical, foreseeable damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) Otherwise, liability is excluded to the extent legally permissible.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">§ 8 Retention of Title</h3>
                <p>
                    (1) The delivered goods remain the property of the Seller until complete payment of all

                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) The Buyer is obliged to treat the goods subject to retention of title with care and 
                    to insure them at his own expense against fire, water, and theft damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (3) In case of conduct contrary to contract by the Buyer, especially in case of default in payment, 
                    the Seller is entitled to take back the goods.
                </p>

                    (2) The Seller is committed to sustainable procurement and transparent supply chains and

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">§ 12 Place of Performance and Jurisdiction</h3>
                <p>
                    (1) The place of performance for all obligations arising from the contractual relationship is Hamburg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this 
                    contract is Hamburg, provided the Buyer is a merchant, a legal entity under public law, 
                    or a special fund under public law.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All legal relationships between the Seller and the Buyer are governed exclusively by the law

                    Sale of Goods (CISG).
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">§ 14 Severability Clause</h3>
                <p>
                    Should individual provisions of these GTC be or become invalid, this shall not affect the validity 
                    of the remaining provisions. In place of the invalid provision, a valid regulation shall apply 
                    that comes closest to the economic purpose of the invalid provision.
                </p>
